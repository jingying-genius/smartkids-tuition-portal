## What is Base44?

I'm not familiar with Base44 - is it a hosting platform your church uses? If you share their deployment process, I can help you adapt the files for it!

If Base44 is an internal church system, you might need to:
1. Upload the `index.html` file to their server
2. Or share the requirements and I'll help you format it properly

---

## After Deployment

You'll get a live URL like:
- Vercel: `https://smartkids-tuition.vercel.app`
- Netlify: `https://smartkids-tuition.netlify.app`
- Surge: `https://smartkids-tuition.surge.sh`

**You can customize the domain name** during deployment or after!

---

## Need Help?

**Can't find the terminal?**
→ Use Vercel/Netlify website method (no terminal needed)

**Want a custom domain?**
→ After deployment, go to project settings → add your domain

**Getting errors?**
→ Just use the drag & drop method on Vercel/Netlify - it always works!

Once deployed, share the URL with:
- Church leadership for feedback
